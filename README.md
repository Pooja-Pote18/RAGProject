**ðŸ§­ Project: Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning**

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning techniques. 
The dataset includes details like age, gender, class, fare, and family relations.

Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn), the data was cleaned, analyzed, and modeled with Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
The final model achieved ~80% accuracy, showing that gender, class, and age are the most significant factors affecting survival.

**Key Steps:**

Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Visualization
Model Training and Evaluation
Accuracy Comparison of Algorithms
Tech Stack: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Result:**
âœ… Accurate prediction of survival with clear data-driven insights.

**The Accuracy of the Model is: 80.42**
